# stellar-films-analysis-queries

This repository contains a personal project based on a fictitious film studio called Stellar Films! I demonstrate some advanced querying that could aid in film production and financial risk management analysis.
I've included a script that creates the database environment and a file with the queries (and a procedure) ready to test.
I've also uploaded some supporting graphs and charts made in Microsoft Excel to example the analysis possible from using the Location ROI query.

The Problem:
Stellar Films Studios is seeing a trend of "Budget Creep" (movies going over budget) and inconsistent returns on investment.

The Solution:
My goal is to write queries that support film production data analysis and help to identify combinations of director, genre, and shooting location that yield the lowest financial risk and highest profitability.

Thanks for viewing!
